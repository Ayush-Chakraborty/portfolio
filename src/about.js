      <br />
      <p>Hello,</p>
      <p>
        I am Soumyadip Payra, a second year undergraduate in the department of
        Computer Science and Technology at NIT Warangal.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I am interested in statistics and its applications in Computer Science
        in the form of Machine-learning and Deep-learning. I learned and
        explored the domain of Computer Vision and tried to implement the
        concepts in some projects. Vision, especially the bio-medical imagery is
        my area of interest.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Recently, I have explored more about RNNs and their applications in the
        domain of NLP, speech recognition etc., projects on which are expected
        to come to completion very soon. I am also about to take a dive into the
        area of Reinforcement Learning.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I am keenly interested in exploring the theoretical part of AI as well
        as hands-on learning through several projects and seeking short-term
        research opportunities in the form of academic internships.
